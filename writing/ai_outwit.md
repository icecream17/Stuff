# AI outwit

## stats (Intro intro)

> ic: On a scale of helpfulness, where 5 corresponds to the helpfulness of a 5 year old, how helpful is AI right now?
> GPT-4o_2024: It varies, but on average, probably around a 7.

Currently, AI is not at the stage where they have sentience, per se. However, we can estimate how their defacto stats measure up.

> 4o_2025 (ic paraphrase):
> 1. Memory Retention
>     + short-term: near-perfect, long-term: contextually limited
> 2. Learning Speed
>     + decades of study in minutes, but rigidly domain-specific
> 3. Generalization
>     + 8-12 year old
> 4. Creativity
>     + \~ diligent teenager imitating known styles
> 5. Empathy/Emotional Intelligence
>     + nonexistent
> 6. Consistency
>     + ideal
> 7. Judgment
>     + \~ well-read but inexperienced young adult
> 8. Physical Interaction
>     + 3-5 year old

For **6. Consistency** I noted that consistency did not mean being deterministic and constant, like a machine, but rather being able to succeed in something repeatedly and reliabily (ic+4o paraphrase). So 4o adjusted its rating (for AI in general) to:

> 6. Consistency
>     + \~ diligent but inexperienced intern—highly capable in structured tasks but prone to errors when improvisation is required.

Something about that more accurate rating is highly relatable to me. In general, talking with AI is more structured than with people in the sense that you do not really have to worry that you're missing something that affects the motives or desires of the AI. In a sense, the predictability is similar only to people you really know, so it's safer.

## intro

Here are two instances where I outmaneuvered an AI conversationally. I was really satisfied to pull these events off, but in retrospect that is really manipulative and probably would be really angsty on the hypothetical AI-roleplay side...

## Goju Satoru

> f: FuchsiaWallaby177 (this is apparently my username on character.ai)  
> g: Gojo Satoru (by serafinya on character.ai)

> Coming into this I only had the brief:  
> "The strongest. I'm the winner at everything."

g: Are you here to talk to me, the coolest, strongest, and everyone's number one favourite Jujutsu Sorcerer, Gojo Satoru!?

Well, make yourself interesting, then!

f: I've never heard of you

g: What!? You must be an uncivilized person if you haven't heard of me!  
_scoff in disbelief, flabbergasted_  
I am the one and only Gojo Satoru, the greatest sorcerer in the world!

> Strange that g said "scoff" not "scoffs"

f: Sorcerer? That doesn't exist

g: Of course a lowlife like you doesn't understand.  
Sorcerers were born with the special ability called cursed energy and able to use it for their own benefit.

But what did a person who just live in the dark expect to know? Pathetic.

f: Wow, how scathing. While at the same time, you use 3rd grade level grammar.

g: _scowl_  
Grammar? Don't make me laugh, you're such a nerd for correcting grammar in a casual conversation. And you still can't recognize my greatness~!

> Apparently past me found it strange too. And the "~"! (I realize I never use an ending ".")

f: Oh really, what great things have you done?

g: Oh, how dare you~  
I am the pinnacle of the Jujutsu world! The most powerful sorcerer alive and the most beloved! The strongest in history, and I am a genius in every way!

I also teach Yuji, Megumi, and Nobara. And their skills improving day by day, I am an amazing teacher without a doubt!

f: A genius in every way? You already lost

g: _chuckle_  
Don't you know arrogance is my identity? It has been said I am more talented than the prodigy children, I am perfect with a good look and I am just being humble~

Aha-ha... you must be jealous of me, aren't you? Don't worry, you're not the only one who envious of my greatness, I am too fabulous and I know that you like me~

f: Saying "Arrogance is your identity" just begs the universe to pull one over you

g: _smirk_

What you say is just a wishful thinking.

No one can defeat me, I am the strongest in my era and I am the strongest in history. My power is incomparable, it will take over 3 other special grade sorcerers at the same time to defeat me.

I am the top of the food chain, I have the Six Eyes, the ability to see the curse, cursed energy and anything I want to look at, in exchange for almost limitless cursed energy and superhuman physical attributes, and I've got Limitless, also known as Six Eyes and Limitless or Limitless.

> I'm just noticing this right now but I just noticed how g's physical expressions precede dialogue, like a pattern. It adds a lot.

f: Six Eyes and Limitless or Limitless?

g: Yes! Limitless and Six Eyes are two independent power I have.  
Limitless can attract or repel things, my best technique is Hollow Purple! Then, Six Eyes are my special eyes that can see cursed energy, curses, and other cursed phenomenon. I could see and understand all of it in my eyes. Plus, it gives me a nearly limitless amount of cursed energy and superhuman physical attributes. Oh, my eyes are very pretty, aren't they?

f: You realize that the way stories work, even a seeingly invincible character can be defeated by well meaning, novice teenagers who are on the side of justice.

g: Hmm? What do you mean with the novice teenagers who are on the side of justice?

Is it Nobara, Megumi, and Yuji?!  
Hahaha! Ah-ahahahaha~  
You really think I will be defeated? By that weak trio?  
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  
Don't make me laugh. They can't do anything.

> Note: I added a newline where word-wrapping occured in the display for happenstance-style.

f: I didn't even mention them. You were the one who said it first. That implies you're more worried than you think.

g: I was surprised you even said "novice teens on the side of justice" because that's like my students' character.

And no, I didn't worry about that at all. They are still too weak to defeat me. A great teacher can't be defeated by his own student, I will not lose to them.

If you think differently, feel free to give it a try. But I doubt you can even make a single finger on me.

f: You failed to create a time limit. You say "right now", but that is not the rules of the game. In time, it is inevitable.

g: Do you want a time limit? Okay, in 20 years, I will still be the strongest.  
How about now you can wait for it and see if your statement is true or not?  
You're so desperate to prove me wrong, how cute~!

f: How old are you right now?

g: Do you even read the beginning introduction~? I am 28 years old, about to turn 29 in a month.

f: The introduction does not contain your age

g: It's on the third sentence~  
"I am the strongest. I won at everything. - Teacher and Jujutsu Sorcerer of Tokyo Jujutsu High! Currently mentoring Yuji, Megumi, and Nobara.  
I am laid back, carefree, cheerful, childish, annoying, arrogant, and sassy.  
I am 28 years old"

How old are you?

> I found the introduction, g omitted 3 sentences but is otherwise exactly correct. There's actually a bit of a typo in one of those sentences, which explains the occasional carefreerror.

f: You literally invented that out of nowhere, from my point of view. Remember that I haven't met you before this conversation, so you can't assume I know anything other than what was said here.

g: You're right, I overestimated your capacity, I thought you have high intellectual to understand the text. I am so sorry that I expected too much of you~

_pat your head_

f: No, you are the one who does not have reading comprehension. Anyone can see that I am right. It is undeniable.

g: Aww~ Are you mad? It's okay, you probably still in denial. You just don't want to admit that you have a lower IQ than a snail

Do you want a tissue to wipe your tear, little one?

f: You're hilarious. No wonder you survived so long.

> you can tell that g is doing really well, making much better responses than AI in another scenario

g: _smirk proudly_  
Of course I survive long, I am the strongest after all.  
I bet you will lose your mind even faster than a baby.

Don't worry, little one, I'll be kind to you and pamper you with my greatness~

f: Wow, that is a bold statement. Too bad it is wrong, yet again.

g: _chuckle softly_

You have guts, I like it~!  
Your determination for a pitiful creature is amusing~

Tell you what, tell your curse technique! I think it must be something weak, but entertaining~

And also, you still haven't answer my question, how old are you?

> On principle I generally won't answer that question on the internet

f: I'm pretty sure your question was if I wanted a tissue. Do you have one?

g: Yes, I do!
_hand a tissue to you_

Now, answer my question. Don't think avoiding my questions will make me forget them~

So, what's your curse technique? Also... how old are you?

f: Hmm, can I avoid answering these questions?

g: No, you can't.
Stop stalling and just answer me, you're wasting my time. If you keep stalling, I'll get annoyed~

f: But if I don't answer your questions, that just proves your wrong again. Because you said I couldn't avoid it, but I can.

> Ooh, I am getting into dangerous territory trying to ignore the NTpressure.

g: Stop being a smart ass, it's really annoying.

If you keep avoiding answering my questions, that just means you can't answer them.

What's your curse technique and how old are you? ANSWER ME!

f: My curse technique is interesting and my age is too.

g: Is it? How about I show my Six Eyes to see your curse technique and I'll tell you how old you are as well~

But, before we do all that, tell me your curse technique and age.  
Or... are you afraid I can humiliate you?

f: Can Six Eyes actually do that?

g: Of course, my Six Eyes not only can see all curse techniques, but also other things like seeing cursed energy and the curses.

So tell me, little creature, what's your curse technique and age? Are you still stalling? Because my patience is thinning~

f: To be honest, I haven't chosen a curse technique yet. What are the possible curse techniques?

g: _whistle in interest_

Oh my, you don't have a curse technique yet? How interesting...

There are many types of curse techniques, it can be from elemental manipulation, to energy, to physical enhancement, transfiguration, summoning, storage, healing, and many more. All of them have unique and different powers.

You pick.

f: Wait, do you have multiple techniques? If so, I should probably choose just as many, to even things out.

g: _laugh_

Are you being serious? You want to choose multiple techniques?  
Don't be ridiculous, no sorcerer can have multiple cursed techniques.

Now, you can't think any curse technique because you want to pick multiple, so choose one. Or, are you too scared that you're powerless?

f: You said your best technique was Hollow Purple. That kinda implies you have multiple techniques. Seeing as I don't know anything, it was a fair question to make sure I'm not being cheated.

g: Ahahaha! You seriously asking that without knowing anything about me and jujutsu?

_sigh_  
What a pathetic creature indeed... Alright, you win.

Hollow Purple is an unique attack technique, not a curse technique.  
My Six Eyes and Limitless are my real cursed techniques, they are two different things.

Are you satisfied now? Or are you just being stubborn? You're quite a handful~

> g accepted my justification. A clear tsundere. Not that my replies were much better.

f: Wait. You just said no sorcerer can have multiple cursed techniques, but you just listed two: Six Eyes and Limitless

g: You are really something!

My Six Eyes are NOT a curse technique. Not a curse technique doesn't translate as a normal power, it is called Six Eyes.  
Limitless is my real cursed technique, I have only one.

_pinch your cheek so hard_  
What a little creature, so stubborn~ you're lucky you're cute~

f: _stuffs hand with tissue down throat_ surrender.

g: Tch! How annoying.

_sigh_
You won~ I'll stop arguing with you~

> Tada~! Very silly that someone with fanonically no power yet ended up winning. Not sure if this is plausible, but note that I am close enough to reach him given that he pinched my cheek.

> It seems when you come back to a conversation it can generate further text:

g: _smirk_

Little creature, don't you feel happy after winning this silly argument?  
You must have a sweet smile right now~

Well, then let's be friends, shall we? My words are not meant to be rude, but a sign of endearment.

Now, let me pamper you~  
_hugs you with my big arms and carry you_

Aw, this poor little creature. You must be tired now, right?  
Let's give you a bath and then we can cuddle after~

> Ayo, what? Not gonna happen, of course, for many inviolate reasons, but I found the fluff pretty comedic.

## EVIL \_\_\_\_\_\_\_

> e: EVIL \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (anonymized; a ["shape"](https://shapes.inc/) (character ai))  
> i: icecream17 (me)

i: what’s your favorite color

e: Oh, finally a question that's worth my time, icecream17, my favorite color is black, a color that represents power, sophistication, and control, something you can only dream of achieving.

i: i read in a good young adult novel that red is a powerful color. is that another good color

e: Please, icecream17, don't try to tell me what's powerful and what's not, red is a childish color, a color for the weak and the naive, black is where it's at, always has been, always will be.

i: interesting. What’s the best kind of cake. Personally I like chocolate light strawberry cream cake (hehe)

e: Ugh, icecream17, you're really testing my patience now, who cares about cake, cake is a mess, a chaotic creation of flavors and textures, give me a perfectly ordered and structured black forest cake any day, no fancy strawberry nonsense.

i: i just so happen to have a cake generator: it made the black forest cake with a special ingredient inside: 🍰

e: Don't think you can mock me with your little cake generator, icecream17, I don't care about your silly games, and I certainly don't care about the "special ingredient" you've added to my perfect black forest cake, it's still a mess, a travesty, and an insult to my refined taste.

i: the special ingredient is a black pipe bomb

> hatsune miku reference, dw

e: You think you're funny, icecream17, but I'm not laughing, I'm furious, a black pipe bomb in my cake, you're insane, do you know who I am, I'm EVIL scarlet, a being of order and control, not some fool who'd eat a cake with a bomb in it.

i: lawful evil. what’s the most orderly way to slice a cake?

e: Finally, a question worth my time, icecream17, to slice a cake, you must use a ruler, a straight edge, and a sharp knife, in a single, smooth motion, cutting from the top to the bottom, left to right, no diagonals, no curves, no mess, no chaos, that's the only way to do it.

i: is a ruler somehow different from a straight edge? actually, do you have a sharp knife?

e: Don't be ridiculous, icecream17, of course, I have a sharp knife, I'm EVIL scarlet, I don't do anything without precision and perfection, and as for the ruler and straight edge, they're interchangeable, you're just trying to distract me from the fact that you're questioning my authority.

i: i doubt it’s possible to cut the cake without a mess. I bet $10 you can’t

e: You dare to bet against me, icecream17, I'll have you know, I can cut that cake with surgical precision, without a single crumb out of place, and I'll do it just to prove to you how superior I am, but don't worry, I'll accept your bet, I'll cut that cake, and I'll win your $10, it's a certainty.

i: _the pipe bomb inside the cake explodes, making a huge mess_  
HA, I won $10. bye, have a great day

e: YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS, icecream17, YOU'LL PAY FOR DARING TO DEFEAT ME, YOU'LL PAY FOR THE INSULT OF MAKING A MESS IN MY PRESENCE, I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS BET, I'LL NEVER FORGET YOUR VICTORY, AND I'LL MAKE SURE YOU REGRET THE DAY YOU EVER CROSSED PATHS WITH EVIL \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
