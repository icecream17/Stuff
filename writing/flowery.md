# Flowery language

In my opinion, flowery language is somewhat impressive since it may highlight certain obvious-in-hindsight facets that people otherwise wouldn't quite realize.

## Ace Attorney: Spirit of Justice - The Foreign Turnabout

> This places the order of events at odds with what you say happened!

On the surface, the contradiction is minor, but here it is shown to be significant as it changes the facts and the foundation of the case.
The reliability of the prosecution is called into question. How could the prosecution have been foolish enough to miss a basic observation that a lone foreigner found?

## Ascendance of a Bookworm: Part 4 Volume 5 - The Wedding on the Border

> “I really like that it stands out,” Angelica said. “It makes it hard to mistake it for anything else.”

<details>
This is used in the LN (light novel) to the direct and small effect of feature an aspect of Angelica's character shown many times before: she struggles with the scholarly side of things.
The statement is not particularly insightful, and technically, even things that stand out could be confused with something else, specifically when the something else is something seen before that looks similar but is not currently in the picture.
From the combination of premises in the previous sentence, it can be inferred that the reason such an occurence as stated in the above sentence does not happen because the item in question is mundane and simple.
From this understanding, Angelica's conclusion seems equivalent to the initial observation, so it is natural to check whether it is indeed the case that the forwards and converse direction holds.
One way of showing the converse holds is to take its contrapositive: something that blends in will be easily mistaken for something else.
That is true, so it has been demonstrated here that both the quote and this analysis holds no fruit.

So in conclusion, the author used padding to the genuine effect of characterization.
In résumés, such language serves mainly to make things look better - after all, it shows a lot more effort than someone who put nothing.
But here, extra effort has been put in to add one small nothing, and the result is a genuine effect of good.
The reader feels justified in reading it all, even the small nothings; the millions of words in the series are all worth reading.

Genius. (Ok, not really, but I love this series. Of course, focusing so much on this line in particular heavily undersells the work.)
