you know what's even better than binary? unary

every number is literally just a line of dots. a line is so much easier to draw than say 01010. Plus, addition is literally just connecting the lines. And multiplication is literally just a thick line with length a and thickness b. But you may say, how do you represent 1/3rd? EZ just have a third of a dot. To make it even easier the dots are squares. In fact this representation means that there are no repeating fractions at all. All you need is one (1) "digit" in the form of an arbitrarily precise picture. Sure, this doesn't exactly work with unicode, but in the future there will be quantum bits. And one qbit could be anything. Surely, Pictographic UNARY will revolutionalize the world.

idk why Enter the Secret Aquarium is possible but not this. You can get up to the top floor... I think you can go through the upstairs door.... wait I remember there are stairs! That's annoying. I wish the whole castle would just move downwards so that the stairs aren't necessary. And the navigation after the stairs. I know nothing about sm64. Is going to rainbow ride similar to tick tock clock? Oh yeah, another neat solution would be to flip the clock upside down. This action would have so much force the ground breaks and all the stars are free

## 2025-04-04 (xss spm abc)

here's a perversion not known to mankind: An unsuspecting sm64 TASer stumbles upon an XSS attack has been revealed in some government website. Using this, we can access secret Nintendo lawsuit files and access a beta version of super paper mario, where jumping is done with the "2" button. Of course, the "A" button used by Mario to 2d-3d flip is unnecessary since in that version we can gather 100000 life shrooms to unlock luigi, which skips to chapter 6, unlocking in combination with XSS, arbitrary code execution, so the entirety of japanese sm64 is emulated within SPM, including japanese float rounding correction despite SPM being for the wii. Finally, SPM luigi is brought within SM64, trivializing the remaining A presses.
