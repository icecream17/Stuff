# empathy open

The idea of an **empathy-open** comes from [_To the Stars_](https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984), where in order to provide certain bounds on behavior, aliens physically must empathy-open to others when requested: reveal their preference-specification.

Essentially the idea is that if you can read enough about a person (in this case, the knowledge is loaded/implanted into your brain), you can understand them so well that you can predict behavior. "There are lies, there are secrets, but there are certain boundaries that should not be possible to cross".

In real life, the process of understanding people so well usually takes a lot of time and shared experiences beyond reading and watching, but hopefully my explanations here will help a little bit to understand me.

Note that obviously I could probably go much deeper on sundry topics, but I don't write by default; if I write, I am prompted to or I happen to feel like it. Right now, a large part of the "prompting" comes from the need to save evidence.
