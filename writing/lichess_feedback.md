Things proposed by various people that I agree with.

+ Timers and usernames above and below the gameboard, large movelist on the right
+ Ability to remove left chat column in gameplay entirely or replace it with more useful things
+ Enabling checkmate when you're already very losing (+5) is not a "blunder". Beyond +10 it's not even an "inaccuracy".
