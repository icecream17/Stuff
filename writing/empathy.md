# Empathy

Empathy is feeling what other people feel, in contrast to sympathy which is an understanding of feelings or reasons behind actions.

For example, in a horror movie imagine a beach in the backyard of a haunted house, and you find a gravestone with your name on it and some ending date. You stare at it for a bit and someone suddenly throws very cold halfway melted ice cream at the back of your neck and it goes down your back like ice.

Maybe reading this, you feel cold shivers, surprise, and/or other possibilities like a little fear, annoyance, or amusement. Now imagine I said this happened to someone else but you still shivered from the cold and felt it as if it were you â€“ that would be empathy.

But say you didn't really have that energy to feel what the other person is feeling, but you understand "yeah, that sucks". That's sympathy.

## Age & sorry

Generally young children do not really have empathy. The classic example is someone saying sorry but not _meaning_ it.

So in the theoretical scenario that you are this young, what do you do when someone  dismisses your "sorry" and you need to _really_ be sorry?

By trying your best to be _really sorry_, saying sorry as extra hard as possible (stolen from lesswrong:)

<todo, lots please and exclamation points and sorry repeat etc>
