sum first three terms in e taylor series + irrationality shows:
e > 5/2

now we show e^e > (5/2)^(5/2) > 6

ie
(5/2) > 6^(2/5)

(5/2)^2 = 25/4 > 6

so
5/2 > 6^(1/2) > 6^(2/5)

qed

ps
(5/2)^5 = 3125/32 = 98 - 11/32

(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 > a^2 - 2ab
fit a^2 - 2ab to 98 - 1/32 and get
a = 7sqrt(2)
b = (11/32)/(14sqrt(2))

So (5/2)^5 > (7sqrt(2) - 11/(32*14sqrt(2))^2

This is probably enough for e^e > 9, but of course far from the true e^e > 15
