+ $x^4 + y^2 = z^4$ implies the characterization $x^2 = m^2 - n^2$ and $z^2 = m^2 + n^2$, and after multiplying we get
  $n^4 + (xz)^2 = m^4$. Notably, the multiplication works in general for any power. The incorrect proof assumed we could
  generalize the characterization too, and ultimately get $x^\text{even} + y^2 = z^\text{even}$ for odd x, which proves FLT.
