  When $n, x, y, z \in \mathbb{N}$ and $x^n + y^n = z^n$, we have $n < x$. Extending this to rationals we get $(\frac{x}{z})^n + ... = 1^n$
  and therefore $n < \frac{x}{z}$ but $\frac{x}{z} < 1$. Of course, we can't extend this to rationals.
+ $x^4 + y^2 = z^4$ implies the characterization $x^2 = m^2 - n^2$ and $z^2 = m^2 + n^2$, and after multiplying we get
  $n^4 + (xz)^2 = m^4$. Notably, the multiplication works in general for any power. The incorrect proof assumed we could
  generalize the characterization too, and ultimately get $x^\text{even} + y^2 \ne z^\text{even}$ for odd $x$, which proves FLT.
