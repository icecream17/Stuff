# intro #

# Instead of reading all this explanation,
# go to anything you're interested in
# and then read back when you're confused

# Sounds less efficient, but it's easier
# and helps develop knowledge

# And it's actually not less efficient
# since you'll only need some of the information


# If you generally know a topic, skip
# comments surrounded by ------

# ------------------
# example ignore
# words words does this help beginners tho?
# two doubly switch three implies one plus one is three
# ------------------

# By default there's no explanation
# but pictures are worth a thousand words
# look on Wikipedia



# file structure, items, and proofs #

# This file is a bunch of items and comments

# Items are like functions,
# they receive values
# and output another value

# In this world, inputs are the hypotheses (givens)
# and the output is ... something

item example_item
 some hypothesis
 some given
 some input
assert
 some thing

# The item asserts a value without proof
# Here's an item that has a proof:

item example_item2
 some hypothesis
 some given
 some input
assert
 some thing
proof
 example_item hyp1 hyp2 hyp3 : some thing

# A proof just calls previous items
# with the right parameters
# until the asserted statement is achieved

# In this case, the proof was trivial,
# just use example_item with hypotheses 1, 2, and 3.
# In more complex proofs, previous steps can also be used as inputs

# Items with proofs are theorems;
# items without are syntax, definitions, or axioms.

# This structure is used for everything here
# which are mainly proofs or assertions
# similar to but not exactly
# "given a is a number, a + 0 is a number"


# Identifiers #

# Some naming conventions are below
# But what's really important is:
# what names are possible?

# e.g. What identifiers are valid?

# An identifier can have these characters:
# abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
# 1234567890+×=/_<>[]!@#$%^&*()-'":;,?`~\|{}€£¥₩°¡¿
# •○●□■♤♡◇♧☆▪︎¤《》...

# <unicode moment>

# basically any unicare that's **not** whitespace,
# control, invisible, non-assigned, deprecated...

# but try to stick to letters and numbers
# or at least chars on the keyboard



# Values and types #

# Remember example_item?
# my attention span is way too low

# looking above it looks like
# All values are preceded by a type

# ----------------
# types can be thought of as collections
# containing all values with some specific
# properties

# for example the type "boolean"
# contains true and false
# ----------------


# items "transform" some typed inputs
# into another, hmm what can this be used for??
# type conversion!!! ...



# "some" is not actually used or defined btw


# Variables #

# types can be followed by a lowercase letter
# in which case it is a variable

# ----------------
# variables that can be replaced with anything
# of the same type...

# as long as the same variables (same letter)
# have the same
# content
# ----------------


# Proofs (old explanation, see above) #

# proofs call previous items with hyps and stps
# and kinda substitutes those with new things
# the last step should be the assertion
# that's it!


# Info about certain types #

# Are explained where they are defined



# Hope this was intuitive and easy to understand
# in contrast to headache inducing
