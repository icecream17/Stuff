1462:
Johny has 254 apples and his friend gives him 1009 more apples
But then he eats 904 apples
And gives Beth 67x apples
and then johny's cat ate 90% of the apples
the Remainder of the apples were dropped off an airplane at the height of 1200 m
such that All of them would land on Walmart's ceiling
However a nuclear missile is heading to collide with the apples
One of your coplayers will try to deploy tornadoes to deflect the missile
at the same time Amogus is trying to enter the Medium inside the Walmart
The Walmart needs to stay on Earth so Johny's Friend will attempt to use even more apples to convince Amogus to use a different location
Meanwhile Beth will trade the apples for dollars. It just so happens that Johny's Friend stole All of Walmart's apples, so the store will gladly made the trade. Beth will then buy the ingredients for pie. A teleportation device will be used to transport the ingredients near the sun to make apple pie very fast. The sun-apple-pie is vital to signal the First Guardian at a Later Time.
However the complex wormhole vector differentials needed require lots of energy. This is most conveniently done by connecting to the sun a bit, but the effect is that Walmart, too, will briefly be irradiated.
Johny's task is therefore to have Everyone leave the Walmart before the sun-transfer happens. 
This can be done by generating water-tornadoes inside the Walmart. Drenching the items is not a problem because of the irradiation, hopefully. Interestingly, a single water-tornado can be alchemized with 7 apples and 27 tornados. the requisite tornados have already been made by Friend and Alpaca of Time yesterday.

(In order to reach the next page, the reader then solves for how many extra apples does Johny need if he wants to make a tornado for each hallway when there are 61 hallways)

Sussus manages to flutterkick out just in time
