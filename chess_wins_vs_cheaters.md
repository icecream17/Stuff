# Wins vs cheaters

Computers are thousands of points better than humans. So how can humans win against cheaters?

First of all, the cheater can't be too obvious. And the better you are, the more likely it is that
you are better than the person that is cheating. So the person that is cheating, who doesn't understand
the position, has to blindly guess at what moves are plausible, and therefore is easier for that person
to get caught.

So, I would assume the hardest cheaters to catch are only a little bit above their level, and they
don't cheat very often. As such, it becomes obvious how humans could possibly beat cheaters.

## Time

Very good players can win against cheaters thanks to _time_. Unsophisticated cheaters must take several
seconds to make a move, so if you last long enough, losing on the board slower than the cheater loses on
the clock, you win.

An alternate strategy is making the cheater lose patience.

For example, this player took 2 minutes on a move, then caught the cheater in a premove:

This player was playing extremely slowly throughout the whole game, which probably contributed to the cheater
speedrunning a singular blunder losing the entire game:
