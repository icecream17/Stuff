   <!-- Used for security. If this tag is used, it goes first.
        See https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/web_security#content-security-policy for more details.
        Also note " upgrade-insecure-requests; " which changes your links from HTTP to HTTPS (without checking if that actually works).

        Below is a reasonably strict guideline, which can be relaxed during testing.
        For example, frameworks sometimes add inline script tags, which can be allowed with "script-src 'self' unsafe-inline;".

        Note that CSPs can only further restrict the policy. So if the server also sends a good CSP, that CSP won't be weakened.
        Incidentally if you control the server headers then this tag isn't needed. -->
