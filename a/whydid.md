# why did you do \<x>?

Usually the real answer to this is something like being tired. So, impulses, distractions, habits, wants, desires, needs, feelings, and such other self-aware answers.

## what if these answers don't work

(In this case you have an explanation but not an excuse, which are assumed invalid. Given that you don't have excuses the only option is something else)

Answer the question "what do I need to do" instead, possibly in the form of a question for help. This technically answers the question since you're implying it's not done because you haven't done one of the steps.

(I don't actually know what to do here but this is my best current guess. It's quite bad without a followup to "why didn't you do that"... so the ask for help hopes to redirect away from that response-question-2)
